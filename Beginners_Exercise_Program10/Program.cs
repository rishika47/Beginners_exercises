﻿//10.1- When you post a message on Facebook, depending on the number of people who like your post,
//Facebook displays different information.
//If no one likes your post, it doesn't display anything.
//If only one person likes your post, it displays: [Friend's Name] likes your post.
//If two people like your post, it displays: [Friend 1] and[Friend 2] like your post.
//If more than two people like your post, it displays: [Friend 1], [Friend 2]
//and[Number of Other People] others like your post.
//Write a program and continuously ask the user to enter different names,
//until the user presses Enter (without supplying a name).
//Depending on the number of names provided, display a message based on the above pattern.
